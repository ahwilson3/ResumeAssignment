          <h3>K20 Auto Repair</h3>
          <p>Autoshop Solutions works with clients all over the US and Canada. One of our local clients that we helped with his marketing services and website was K20 Auto Repair. They are based in Holly Springs and were a pleasure to work with. This was one of the first websites on our new template. After working with the different teams and the client, we were able to create a website that the cleint loved. The templates have some placeholder content but it is always fun to design them and customize them to meet the client's needs.

          <h3>Noble Auto Service</h3>
          <p>Templates are not the only type of websites that I work on. We also provide clients with custom websites on higher packages. One of our most successful clients, Noble Auto Service, came into production becuase they wanted to redesign their current website and add a location. After working with the client, our design and development team was able to create a website that the client was looking for. After tweaking a few elements, we got the website just right for the client.
